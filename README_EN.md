Tencent's Hunyuan Turbo S model has been listed on the official website of Tencent Cloud. Developers and enterprise users can call it via API. It has been gradually rolled out on Tencent Yuanbao today for users to use and experience.

On February 27, Tencent's self-developed fast-thinking model, Turbo S, was officially released. Different from slow-thinking models such as Deepseek R1 and Hunyuan T1, which need to "think for a while before replying", Hunyuan Turbo S can achieve "instant replies". The typing speed is doubled, the first-word latency is reduced by 44%, and it also shows outstanding performance in knowledge, mathematics, creation, etc. Through model architecture innovation, the deployment cost of Turbo S has also been significantly reduced, continuously lowering the threshold for the application of large models. Studies have shown that about 90% - 95% of human daily decisions rely on intuition. Fast thinking is like human "intuition", providing fast response capabilities for large models in general scenarios, while slow thinking is more like rational thinking, providing problem-solving ideas through logical analysis. The combination and supplementation of fast thinking and slow thinking can make large models solve problems more intelligently and efficiently.

On many publicly available Benchmarks commonly used in the industry, Tencent Hunyuan Turbo S shows performance comparable to that of industry-leading models such as DeepSeek V3, GPT 4o, and Claude 3.5 in multiple fields such as knowledge, mathematics, and reasoning.

It is reported that through the fusion of long and short thinking chains, Tencent Hunyuan Turbo S maintains the fast-thinking experience for liberal arts questions. Based on the long thinking chain data synthesized by the self-developed Hunyuan T1 slow-thinking model, it significantly improves the scientific reasoning ability and achieves an overall improvement in the model's performance. In terms of architecture, by innovatively adopting the Hybrid-Mamba-Transformer fusion mode, Hunyuan Turbo S effectively reduces the computational complexity of the traditional Transformer structure and reduces the KV-Cache cache occupation, resulting in a decrease in training and inference costs. The new fusion mode breaks through the difficulties of high long-text training and inference costs faced by traditional pure Transformer structure large models. On the one hand, it gives full play to Mamba's ability to efficiently process long sequences, and on the other hand, retains the Transformer's advantage in capturing complex context, constructing a hybrid architecture that is optimal in both video memory and computing efficiency. This is the first time in the industry that the Mamba architecture has been successfully applied to super-large MoE models without loss.

As a flagship model, Turbo S will become the core base for the derivative models of Tencent Hunyuan series in the future, providing basic capabilities for derivative models such as reasoning, long-text, and code. Based on Turbo S, by introducing technologies such as long thinking chains, retrieval enhancement, and reinforcement learning, Tencent has self-developed the reasoning model T1, which has been launched on Tencent Yuanbao. Users can choose either the Deepseek R1 or Tencent Hunyuan T1 model for answering. Tencent Hunyuan said that the official version of the Tencent Hunyuan T1 model API will also be launched soon to provide external access services.

Developers and enterprise users can already call Tencent Hunyuan Turbo S via API on Tencent Cloud. A one-week free trial is available within one week from today. In terms of pricing, the input price of Turbo S is 0.8 yuan/million tokens, and the output price is 2 yuan/million tokens, several times lower than the price of the previous Hunyuan Turbo model.
